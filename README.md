# Libft 🚀

## Overview 📚
**Libft** is a custom implementation of standard C library functions. This project, part of the **42cursus**, involves creating a C library that includes numerous general-purpose functions. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of how these fundamental functions work and developed strong skills in C programming, memory management, and algorithm implementation.

## Key Skills and Concepts Learned 🛠️

### C Programming 💻
- **Standard Library Functions**: I reimplemented standard library functions such as `strlen`, `memcpy`, and `strchr` to understand their inner workings.
- **Memory Management**: I gained expertise in dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`. I ensured no memory leaks in the implemented functions.
- **Error Handling**: I ensured all functions handle errors gracefully, avoiding unexpected crashes like segmentation faults and bus errors.

### Data Structures 🌳
- **Linked Lists**: I implemented a set of functions to manipulate linked lists, including creating nodes, adding nodes to the front and back, and traversing and deleting nodes. This enhanced my understanding of dynamic data structures and pointer manipulation.

### Makefile and Build Automation ⚙️
- **Makefile**: I created a comprehensive Makefile to automate the compilation process, including rules for building the library, cleaning up object files, and recompiling. This involved using flags such as `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror` to ensure code quality and compliance with project standards.

### Code Organization and Best Practices 📏
- **Modular Code**: I organized code into separate modules for better readability and maintainability. I used static functions to restrict the scope of helper functions.
- **Norm Compliance**: I adhered to the 42 school's Norm, a set of coding standards that enforce good coding practices, ensuring consistency and readability across the project.

## Project Highlights 🌟

### Custom Library Functions 📜
- **String Manipulation**: Functions such as `ft_strjoin`, `ft_substr`, and `ft_strtrim` provided hands-on experience with handling strings in C, including concatenation, substring extraction, and trimming.
- **Conversion Functions**: I implemented `ft_itoa` to convert integers to strings, enhancing my skills in numerical algorithms and character manipulation.

### Bonus Features 🎁
- **Advanced List Operations**: I developed additional functions for linked lists, such as `ft_lstmap` for applying a function to each element and creating a new list, showcasing my ability to extend basic data structures with more complex functionality.

## Conclusion 🏁
Completing the **Libft** project was a significant milestone in my programming journey. It provided me with a solid foundation in C programming and a deep understanding of essential concepts that are crucial for any software development role. The skills and knowledge gained through this project have prepared me to tackle more complex programming challenges and contribute effectively to any development team.
